# An Agent-Based Model for Assessing Agricultural Water Market Structure and Function


## Description
An agent-based model (ABM) is developed to simulate irrigation water rights leasing at  watershed scale in response to drought. The model allows for variation in farm characteristics, water rights seniority, diversion location in the watershed, differences in agent preferences and information, and alternative market frameworks. The model is used to examine the effect of drought on trading activity and gains from trade under three  market models: Bilateral trading with random matching, a “Smart Market” that actively matches bidders based on their bids and asks, and a full-information optimization trading that represents the efficient benchmark against which to assess other market models. The effect of non-pecuniary factors such as preferences for active farming versus leasing and fallowing is also simulated. The results show several patterns.  Gains from trade and market participation are largest with moderate drought severity than with either severe or weak drought. Gains from trade and trading activity are also highest when bids and offers are matched by full information optimization approach, and when senior water rights holders prefer active farming to lease and fallow. The applications presented in this paper illustrate the broad applicability of the ABM framework to water resource problems under appropriative water rights systems of the Western United States.
