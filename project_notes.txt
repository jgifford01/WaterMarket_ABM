01/10/2024 Notes:
- maybe we want to eliminate the interation through drought profiles for the final package, obiviously we need to keep it for the paper
- We may 
https://hpc.wsu.edu/programmers-guide/python/
- are we keeping track of who is trading with who?
- we need to go over potential adaptations for the code. Reetwika said she had a list.
- welfare costs of climate shocks.
- run each drough number over one thread, then combine at end. Make it more efficient.
- how do we compare welfare of no drought at all, if GFT is our only metric?


01/13/2024 Notes:
time under pd concat: Time taken for simulation 1:  30.93202233314514
time under original: Time taken for simulation 1:  48.66238355636597
started pep-8 spacing rule
- run each drought number over a different parallel task. 


01/20/2024 Notes:

- Can we implement a reinforcement learning functionality to the model, where if a farmer trades, they are rewarded, but if they don't they are less likely to participate in the future?
- Monte carlo with random draws from percipitation distribution
